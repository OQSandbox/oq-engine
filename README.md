This repository is intended for testing the implementation of prototype and/or similar experimental features (potentially for later integration into the OQ engine).

The code comes with NO WARRANTY of fitness for purpose, and the user SHOULD download only the official OpenQuake code (https://github.com/gem/oq-engine) where quality assurance and verification is a requirement. The repository is also not run under Continuous Integration with OpenQuake.

For development or contributions to code the use is recommended to adopt the steps for developer installation of OpenQuake (https://github.com/gem/oq-engine/blob/master/doc/installing/development.md) subsituting the clone of the official OQ repository for the clone of this one. For all other development related notes see the information here: https://github.com/gem/oq-engine/blob/master/doc/developers-notes.md
