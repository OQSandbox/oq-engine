The same rupture described in the Scenario Damage demo is also used for this
demo. In this case, a combined job file, job.ini, is used to specify the
configuration parameters for the hazard and risk calculations.

To run the Scenario Risk demo, users should navigate to the folder where the
required files have been placed and employ following command:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize,frame=single,bgcolor=lightgray]{shell-session}
user@ubuntu:~\$ oq engine --run job.ini
\end{minted}

and the following outputs should be produced:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize,frame=single,bgcolor=lightgray]{shell-session}
